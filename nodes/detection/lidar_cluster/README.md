# Detection - lidar_cluster


## cluster_detector

ROS node that clusters point cloud data and publishes detected objects.


#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Default Value | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- | ------------ |
| `min_cluster_size` | int | `5` | Minimum number of points in a cluster. Clusters smaller than this will be ignored. |
| `bounding_box_type` | string | `"axis_aligned"` | Type of bounding box. It can be `"axis_aligned"` for axis-aligned bounding box, or `"min_area"` for minimum area bounding box. |
| `enable_pointcloud` | bool | `False` | Whether to publish point cloud data for each detected object. |
| `enable_convex_hull` | bool | `True` | Whether to calculate a convex hull for the cluster points. |
| `target_frame` | string | `"map"` | Target frame for the detected objects. |
| `transform_timeout` | float | `0.05` | Timeout in seconds for waiting for a transform to become available.


#### Subscribed Topics

| Name | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| `/points_clustered` | `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` | Clustered point cloud data.


#### Published Topics

| Name | Type | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| `/detected_objects` | `autoware_msgs/DetectedObjectArray` | Detected objects. Each object includes its label, position, orientation, dimensions, and color. The `valid` flag indicates whether the object is valid. If `enable_pointcloud` is true, each object also includes a point cloud representing the cluster of points belonging to that object. |



## ground_removal

ROS node for filtering ground points from a 3D point cloud.

## points_clusterer

This node subscribes to a point cloud topic and clusters the points using DBSCAN algorithm. It downsamples the input data to a fixed size before clustering, to reduce processing time. It publishes the clustered point cloud data to a separate topic.


#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `~sample_size` | int | `10000` | Number of points to downsample from the input point cloud. |
| `~cluster_epsilon` | float | `1.0` | The maximum distance between two points to be considered as part of the same cluster. |
| `~cluster_min_size` | int | `7` | Minimum number of points required to form a cluster. |


#### Subscribed Topics

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/points_no_ground` | `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` | The input point cloud data. |


#### Published Topics

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/points_clustered` | `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` | The clustered point cloud data. |
